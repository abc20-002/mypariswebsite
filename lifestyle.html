      <h3>LIFESTYLE IN PARIS</h3>
      <p>When one thinks about Paris they think about endless activities<br>
      The following are places you might want to visit, may it be attreactions, or fashion boutiques<br>
    We also get to see how people in Paris go about their life.</p>

      <h4>FASION SECTION</h4>
      <p>Paris has been the fashion capital of the Western world from <br>the seventeenth century to the twenty-first
        century.<br>As you may alredy know ,most of the best Luxury brands are made in paris, like Louis Vuitton and Dior

        <h4>#1 Le Centre Commercial</h4>
        <img src="images/Le Centre Commercial.jpg">

        <p>Where else to shop for the Parisian jeans-and-sneakers aesthetic than the concept store opened by the founders of Veja?<br>
           There’s plenty more besides to discover from Sébastien Kopp and <br>François-Ghislain Morillion’s impressive roll-call of
           designers. Pick up Oxford shirts, cosy
          sweatshirts and – obvs – some Veja high-tops.<br> Their ranges include menswear and womenswear,
          plus small lifestyle and kids’ collections.</p>


          <h4>#2 Merci</h4>
          <p>Merci might sell itself as a concept store but really it’s a mini-grand magasin – and one with some pretty impressive
             ethics <br> (they help support an educational foundation in Madagascar). <br>Their collections include fashion, design and
             homewares, but it’s the regular showcases of up-and-coming <br> makers and collaborations with the likes of L/Uniform, Taion
             and Rizzoli that set this place apart.</p>

             <h4>#3 A La Ville de Rodez</h4>
             <p>Time-capsule shops are becoming ever rarer in Paris, <br> making the 100-year reign of A La Ville de Rodez on Rue
               Vieille-du-Temple even more special. <br>This traiteur specialises in all things from the Auvergne and Aveyron regions,
                particularly foie gras, cheese and saucisson. <br>All sliced to order, bien sûr. Products from further afield
                 include 24-month aged comté from the Jura, <br>goats’ cheeses from the Loire and the legendary Prince de Paris
                 ham.</p>
